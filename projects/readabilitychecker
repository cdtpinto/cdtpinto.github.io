# Readability Checker

Netbeans plugin that tests software readability using some software readability formulas.

## Implemented Formulas

Currently, Readability Checker implements three software readability formulas:

* Comments Ratio
* Software Readability Ease Score (SRES)
* Posnett Hindle Devanbu (PHD)

### Comments Ratio

Proposed, in 2002, by the researchers Krishan K. Aggarwal, Yogesh Singh and Jitender Kumar Chhabra in the article [An Integrated Measure of Software Maintainability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/981648/).

### SRES

Theorized by Jürgen Börstler, Michael E. Caspersen e Marie Nordström, the general principles of this readability formula was first introduced in 2007 in the article [Beauty and the Beast Toward a Measurement Framework for Example Program Quality](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8c41/1a1fb987966f2020765069dc21881826e635.pdf), then it's logic was implemented in a readability tool titled [Properties of "Good" Java Examples](http://www8.cs.umu.se/education/examina/Rapporter/NadeemAbbas_v2.pdf) by Nadeem Abbas, and later on, in 2015, the SRES readability formula was actually proposed in the article [Beauty and the Beast: on the readability of object-oriented example programs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-015-9267-5).

### PHD

This readability formula was proposed by Daryl Posnett, Abram Hindle and Prem Devanbu, in 2011, in the article [A Simpler Model of Software Readability](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1985454).
