# Details for the Implemented Sorting Algorithms

### [Bubble Sort](#bubble-sort)

General idea: go through all the values in a list several times, and for each iteration, "float" the biggest element to the top of the list

Time complexity: O(n^2)

(...)

### [Quick Sort](#quick-sort)

General idea: (...)

Time complexity: (...)
