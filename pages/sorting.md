# Details for the Implemented Sorting Algorithms

### [Bubble Sort](#bubble-sort)

General idea: go through all the values in a list several times, and for each iteration, "float" the biggest element to the top of the list

Average case time complexity: O(n^2)

In place: yes

### [Quick Sort](#quick-sort)

General idea: this is a devide and conquer algorithm. The algorithm picks a pivot element and then partitions then, partitions the given array around the picked element.

Average case time complexity: O(nLogn)

In place: yes

### [Selection Sort](#selection-sort)

General idea: repeatedly finds the minimum element in the unsorted array and puts it in the beginning of the array.

Average case time complexity: O(n^2)

In place: yes
